			&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>  Meta-learning techniques in Reinforcement Learning, with applications
on multi-agent cooperative tasks. The game of Hanabi</strong>
		</h5>
      <article>
        <p>
           <span class="math inline"> Recently Google released a new testbed for RL. The game of Hanabi has many new complexities that older testbed games like Chess and Go
             do not exhibit. Apart from a quite big state space, the game involves partial information and cooperation between agents. This cooperation is extremely difficult
          to model because communication between agent can contain meta-information. Although agents that are trained together can achieve high scores, when aggents with different
          learning experience meet, they exhibit poor performance. The goal is to apply meta-learning ideas to train the agents, so they will be able to adapt to new enviroments (different set of cooperative agents).
