			&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong> Solving cooperative or mixed type games using Reinforcement learning/evolutionary techniques in conjuction with metalearning approaches.</strong>
		</h5>
      <article>
        <p>
           <span class="math inline">These projects are seperated in three parts and more than one people can work on. The first part is the creation of agents that play a specific 
		   game (preference for the game to have an intrinsic fitness test...or to exist somewhere a way to measure the performance of our agents). Second part is the development of a 
		   metalearning techinque that can model a new agent (ad-hoc setting) as fast as possible. Third part is the creation of meta agent that can "understand" its teammates and
		   deploy a strategy that depends on them. Games that we are currently working on: Chess, RenGO, Phantom GO, Hanabi, Starcraft_mini_ganes. Games I would like to work on:
		   Quantum_chess, Dota2_mini_games.

			&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong> Anything Quantum related. From Quantum Neural Networks to Quantum Chess </strong>
		</h5>
      <article>
        <p>
           <span class="math inline"> This is a field that I would like to gain some knowledge on by playing around. If you feel the same, we can start a project (master thesis) in that 
		   direction. If you like games, one idea is to create agents that play this very cool chess alternative  <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/453870/Quantum_Chess/"> Quantum Chess </a>. 
		   One needs also to build the enviroment from scratch which makes it a quite demanding project. This option would be really demanding but 
		   I believe it will have a high payoff. </span>

			&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>  Creating a Neural network which analyzes the decision process of humans reacting on a
			random dot stimuli.</strong>
		</h5>
      <article>
        <p>
           <span class="math inline"> There are several analytical models that interpret how humans process the uncertainty created by a random dot kinematographic (RDK), and 
		   produce a number that captures the "belief" of a subject over the hidden-state of the dots. These models operate on various assumptions and there 
		   is no obvious way to test if they actually behave the way they claim they do. However, there is a way to check if these belief satisfy some properties that 
		   control theory/decision making theory dictates. The goal is the creation of a Machine learning model that gets some input a RDK and the time of an action and 
		   spilts out a belief over the hidden-state of the dots. The model will be trained on part of our data and tested on the rest. Then its predicting power will
		   be compared with one of the analytical models that we have at hand.

			&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong> Welcome to my <del>tinder</del> supervising profile. My job position does not require me to supervise any Master thesis. 
			Provided that I receive many emails per week for such a request, I do not answer back to all of them. There are classes of emails that 
			are more likely to not be answered. Cases like that include, emails from  
			<p> a) people who seem that they send copy-paste messages until they get a postive response from somewhere.</p>
			<p> b) people that need "taking by the hand" supervision. </p>
			<p> c) people that just need to learn a technique to put in their CV for their job application. </p>
			<p> d) people who are more into titles than learning and exploring. </p>
			<p> e) people that know everything. I receive mails from students, having answers to my research problems. If I want a relationship with conflict,
				I will hang out with my gf...thank you very much. I do believe that modesty lives in the minds of those who balance intelligence with wisdom. People who 
				see the vast complexity in things, are rarely cocky. The worst thing is that I used to be one of these @#!$@. It is possible sometimes that intelligence
				can be ahead of wisdom, so I may make exceptions for people that can back off their attitude...but it is unlikely for you to be one of those. 
			<p> f) people that are unlucky. Some of you send very nice emails, but I may receive them when I am ultra busy.	
			<p> I also do not like the use of the word "Mr". Either address me in a casual manner...totally cool with that, or if you <em>  have</em> to use polite language, call me 
				dr (at least like that I have some seconds of feeling like a rapper every time I read a new email). </p>
			I know that all these sound very rigid, but it helps with my sanity. With students that I start a master thesis, I try to devote as much time as
			needed and I get emotionally invested on their progress. Also most projects that I am suggesting are projects that I am working on, so I may get extra passionate about it.
			Last thing: If we start a thesis together, you have to set your own working boundaries. When I get passionate about something, I may tend to ask for more results. It is hard to put boundaries for
			you. However, I really know how to respect boundaries, so if you put any I will not push through them.
