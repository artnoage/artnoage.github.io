			&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>  Meta-learning techniques for few-shot behavior prediction in multi-agent Ad-Hoc cooperation. The game of Hanabi</strong>
		</h5>
      <article>
        <p>
           <span class="math inline"> Recently Google released a new testbed for RL. The game of Hanabi has many new complexities that older testbed games like Chess and Go
             do not exhibit. Apart from a quite big state space, the game involves partial information and cooperation between agents. This cooperation is extremely difficult
          to model because communication between agent can contain meta-information. Although agents that are trained together can achieve high scores, when aggents with different
          learning experience meet, they exhibit poor performance. The goal is to apply meta-learning ideas to train the agents, so they will be able to adapt to new enviroments (different set of cooperative agents).

			&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong> Creating pool of agents for board games using evolutionary methods.</strong>
		</h5>
      <article>
        <p>
           <span class="math inline"> The goal is to create a list of acting rules that one can use to play a board game (most likely Hanabi), and then use evolutionary techniques to 
		   create agents that perform well in the game, by applying part of these rules. Statistical analysis can further be made to characterize diversity of the agents 
		   and fitness. The project is a bit tedious, but it is straightforward.

			&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong> Welcome to my <del>tinder</del> supervising profile. My job position does not require me to supervise any Master thesis. 
			I have no contractual or moral obligation to do so. Provided that I receive many emails per week for such a request, 
			I do not answer back to all of them. There are classes of emails that are more likely to not be answered. Cases like that include, emails from  
			<p> a) people who seem that they send copy-paste messages until they get a postive response from somewhere</p>
			<p> b) people that need "taking by the hand" supervision </p>
			<p> c) people that just need to learn a technique to put in their CV for their job application </p>
			<p> d) people who are more into titles than learning and exploring </p>
			<p> e) people who sent me emails in German (I know we are in Germany and I respect that, but getting an email like that it means that you haven't noticed
				things about me written in my profile). </p>
			<p> f ) people that know everything. I receive mails from students, having answers to my research problems. If I want a relationship with conflict,
				I will hang out with my gf...thank you very much. I do believe that modesty is a matter of intelligence and wisdom. The worst thing is that I used to be one of these @#!$@. I may make exceptions
				for people that can back off their attitude...but it is unlikely to be one of those. Three years now I only met one person like that.
			<p> g) people that are unlucky. Some of you send very nice emails, but I may receive them when I am ultra busy.	
			<p> I also do not like the use of the word "Mr" (either address me in a casual manner...totally cool with that or if you <em>  have</em> to use polite language, call me 
				dr. </p>
			I know that all these sound very rigid and assholy, but it helps with my sanity. With students that I start a master thesis, I try to devote as much time as
			needed and I get emotionally invested on their progress. Also most projects that I am suggesting are projects that I am working on, so I may get extra passionate about it.
			Last thing: If we start a thesis together, you have to set your own working boundaries. When I get passionate about something, I may tend to ask for more results. It is hard to put boundaries for
			you. However, I really know how to respect boundaries, so if you put any I will not push through them.
